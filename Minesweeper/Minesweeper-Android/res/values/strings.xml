    <string name="form_intro">This is a research project that tries to gather insight on how blind people play games on mobile
devices and how developers could make games that are not only accessible, but also enjoyable
for them. To fulfill these goals, we would like to know some details about you and how you
interact with technologies in general and games in particular. This will help us to interpret your
answers to this questionnaire. All the information collected through this questionnaire will be
anonymous, untraceable and will be treated confidentially and only used for the purpose of the
study. \n</string>
