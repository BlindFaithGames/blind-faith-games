				<answer author="Pirate">Guybrush Threepwood? Ha ha ha!!! That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush"></answer>
				<answer author="Pirate">But it's not even a name!</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush"> Well, what's YOUR name?</answer>
				<answer author="Mancomb">My name is Mancomb Seepgood. So, what brings you to M?l?e Island anyway?</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">I want to be a pirate!</answer>
				<answer author="Mancomb">Oh, really? You should go talk to the important-looking pirates inthe next room. They're pretty much in charge around here. They can tell you where to go and what to do.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">Where can I find the Governor?</answer>
				<answer author="Mancomb">Governor Marley? Her mansion is on the other side of town. But pirates aren't as welcome around her place as they used to be.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">Why not?</answer>
				<answer author="Mancomb"> Well, the last time she had a pirate over for dinner, he fell in love with her. It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">How's that?</answer>
				<answer author="Mancomb">Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next... But I don't believe a word of it. Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it. He takes the whole thing seriously. VERY seriously. Uh-oh, it looks like my grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me. Nice talking to you. Have fun on M?l?e Island.</answer>

				<answer author="Esteva">Yeah, so what?</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">Who's this pirate that's bugging the Governor?</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">LeChuck? He's the guy that went to the Governor's for dinner and never wanted to leave. He fell for her in a big way, but she told him to drop dead. So he did. Then things really got ugly.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">What's so scary about this LeChuck guy?</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">LeChuck was a fearsome pirate. He tried to impress the Governor by sailing off to find the Secret of Monkey Island?. But a mysterious came up and sank his ship, leaving no survivors. We thought that was the end of the fearsome pirate LeChuck. We were wrong.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush"> What happened then?</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">He still sails the waters between here and Monkey Island?. His ghost ship is an unholy terror upon the sea. That's why we're all in here and not out pirating.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">What happened to your eye?</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">Well, I was putting in my contact lens when--Hey, wait a second! That's none of your business!</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">Excuse me, but I'm looking for the dart board.</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">Dart board? We don't have one anymore. There was a horrible accident. Drinking and darts don't mix.</answer>
				<answer author="Guybrush">Where can I get a drink?</answer>
				<answer author="Esteva">A drink? You could wait for the cook to notice you... but that could take all day. Just find a mug and sneak into the kitchen. That's what we all do. Look, this whole LeChuck thing has me pretty shaken up. So if you don't mind...</answer>
