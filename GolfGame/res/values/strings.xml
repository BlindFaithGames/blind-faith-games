		The first one is enabled by default, allows you shoot, doing a quick scroll on the shot area. 
		Using Slingshot mode you have to do a tap, drag and release your finger to shot.\n
		2 - Info target allows you to find the hole by simply touching and dragging on the screen. \n
		3 - Sound post-shot enables to play a sound whose pitch is decreased during a shot.\n
		4 - Vibration and Sound feedback - before you shot, a vibration/sound will help you to find where is the hole. To use them during
		the game you have to describe an arc by dragging your finger on the shot area. You will find the shot area at the bottom on the screen. If you try to do this gestures
		outside the shot area you will hear a beep sound. The louder vibration/sound you feel/heard, 
		the more accurate will be your shoot. Moreover in sound feedback,
		if you use headphones, the sound will be played only on one headphone. That indicates that the best position is on the left
		or on the right from your actual position while you point describing an arc dragging your finger on the shot area.\n
		you will find more information in the game tutorial.
