		The board is a grid of cells, and some of them are hiding a mine. Your 
		goal is to find all of those mines, without detonating any of them.\n\n\n
		To accomplish that, you can press any cell -dig mode- or mark -exploration mode- 
		it with a flag,if you are sure it contains a mine. When you press a cell, several cells
		can be discovered, and they will show you how many mines are around them.\n\n\n
		If you want to play in explore mode - markings cells with flags - just
		press menu button and you will be able to turn on that mode (do the same
		to turn it of again).\n\n\n
		Options: make use of the settings while in the main menu in order to 
		turn on coordinates service as well as music.
